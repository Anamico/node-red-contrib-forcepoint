## Overview

The [Forcepoint](https://www.forcepoint.com/) firewall Node-RED client package enables the development of flows in
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) which use Forcepoint features (update firewall rule, etc.) and enable integration with other security components, such as via the
[Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx) (DXL) fabric (such as with
[node-red-contrib-dxl-tie-client](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@opendxl/node-red-contrib-dxl-tie-client)).
